## I don’t like note taking apps, because they don’t care about notes...

So I’m a building _SnidBit_, a note taking app focused on creating and organizing notes.

I want to strip it of typical note application features that have nothing to do with notes. No reminders. Use a reminder app for that. No todo lists. Plenty of apps can do that better. And project management workflows in a note app? Look elsewhere.

Documents may contain a collection of notes, but a document is not a note. Notes are brief and our thoughts are often fleeting. You should be able to take notes quickly. So no fancy formatting editors - we aren’t concerned with creating documents - just markdown.

### Then what are the differentiating features?

- You should be able to add annotations to any note - and be able to distinguish them from the actual notes.
- You should be able to break up a document of notes into individual notes.
- You should be able to organize my notes on a canvas to see them all at once.
- You should be able to view the history of your notes as they change over time.
- You should be able to create collections of notes for different projects.
- You should be able to share your notes while working in public.

> Our minds are messy. While we still need structure, we shouldn’t be forced to organize our thoughts in a rigid way.
